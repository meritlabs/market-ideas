## Merit Market Ideas

While there's a dedicated channel for the same purpose in our Discord, we think it's not quite suitable for sharing ideas on product enhancements - live chats are simply not designed for that. With that in mind, we've decided to create this repo to make sure none of your bright ideas will be lost because of how fast flowing live chats can be.

## Issue creation guidelines:

**Title**:
Make it short, yet complete enough to briefly understand the idea by just reading the title.

**Problem**:
Describe the problem you have, are concerned about having in the future, or think other users might struggle with. Adding a real world example is helpful.

**Solution**:
Describe the solution for your problem. Make it as detailed as possible.

[Here](https://github.com/meritlabs/market-ideas/issues/1) is an example of what it should look like.
